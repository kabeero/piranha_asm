# piranha_asm

This repository contains the assembler and assembly code for the PIRANHA camera.

The python script can be run with 
```./npasm -o out -a -l src/myfile.npasm```

to generate the outputs:
```
out/myfile.lst
out/myfile.txt
```

The former is easier to debug, with the latter being machine code.
